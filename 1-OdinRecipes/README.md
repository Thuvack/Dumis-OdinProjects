# odin-recipes
This is project submission as part of the foundation path in web development course on the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com), to build real, working websites.


## The recipes

Being South Africa, I chose local cousine dishes and available recipes online. I love food and these are dishes I enjoy sharing with friends.
