# Dumis-OdinProjects
A master repo for all my Odin Projects. I started the odin projects by creating individual repositories. Now I am interested in merging them into one repository, to suit my OCD.

# odin-recipes
This is project submission as part of the foundation path in web development course on the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com), to build real, working websites.


## The recipes

Being South Africa, I chose local cousine dishes and available recipes online. I love food and these are dishes I enjoy sharing with friends.
