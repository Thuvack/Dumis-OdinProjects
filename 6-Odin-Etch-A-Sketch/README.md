# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is an implementation of the Etch a sketch project in a browser environment, created as part of my [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) assignment for the foundation phase.

## Some important lessons

- Use css grid and grid-auto-flow to create and populate cells inside the sketchpad grid.
