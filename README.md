# odin-landing-page

This is project submission as part of the foundation path in web development course on the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com), to build real, working websites.


## Page content choice

I chose to create a page about South African national symbols. Firstly to refresh my knowledge about these, but secondly, because I really think they are aesthetically appealing.
